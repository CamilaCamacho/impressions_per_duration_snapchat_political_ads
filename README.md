# Analyzing Success of Snapchat Political Ads by Number of Impressions for Duration
Exploring [Snapchat's Political and Advocacy Ads Library](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/) data to find if there is any relationship between timing and number of impressions of political and advocacy advertising Snapon Snapchat.  

## Industry Question: 
Can number of impressions for a political/advocacy advertisement in 2019 be predicted based on when the ad was set up to start delivering or on how long it ran for?

## Data Question & Metrics: 
* Outline Data Analytics Process
In order to get a comprehensive analysis of timing of political/advocacy ads throughout an entire year, I will be using the [2019 archives](https://github.com/CamilaCamacho/timing_of_impressions_snapchat_political_ads/blob/master/PoliticalAds.csv).

### Metrics 
* For sake of precision and since Snapchat ads are usually short videos, duration of ad run-time will be measured in **seconds**.
* Success of a political/advocacy ad will be measured in number of **impressions** which Snapchat defines as the number of times the Ad has been viewed by Snapchatters. 
* Duration will be calculated using **Start Date** (time at which the Ad was set up to start delivering) and, where possible, **End Date** (time at which the Ad was set up to stop delivering). No information on end date means that the Ads may be running indefinitely or until an Advertiser pauses the campaign.[(1)](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/en-US/article/political-ads-library)
